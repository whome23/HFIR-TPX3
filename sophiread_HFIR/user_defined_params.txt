# ABS
abs_radius 5 					# in number of pixels 
abs_min_cluster_size 15  		# minimum cluster size. in number of pixels(05232023@cg4b we confirmed with neutron counts with different `abs_min_cluster_size` this geve us 78% efficiency compared with He3 detector)
abs_max_cluster_size 10000  		# maximum cluster size. in number of pixels
spider_time_range 500000 			# in nanoseconds
